Frostbyte is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Arma 3.

# Want to contribute?

We at Daxalon love open source software and also love when other developers assist in the development.
With this project specifically we'd love to have other developers help us in the development.

Frostbyte will hopefully become a great tool to help modders mod Arma 3!
